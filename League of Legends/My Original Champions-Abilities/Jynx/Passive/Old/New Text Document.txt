I've made it so AP/AD isn't converted, but gained, so Items/Runes can still scale off of it, 
but i simply made it so his abilities and AAs don't scale with it, instead using "Unbound Matter"



I've also made it so Penetration is only half as effective, otherwise Magic Pen into Armor Pen would be insanely OP.

The reason i created a whole "Unbound Matter" system, and not used Adaptive Force as i originally intentended, was to give the chance to have the Ratio modified in the future, if need may be.
Had i used Adaptive directly, this would have not been possible as it would have impacted the whole game. Basically, whilst it does also fit thematically, it is also a BIG balance lever for the character.
