
CORE MOD

This Mod is based on LazyBone's New trasformation Mod.

This requires his "Installer" to be installed in your game.

This trasformation set REPLACES his "Super Saiyan All [UI moveset swap AND No healt requirement] (SS1-2-3-G-B-KK-KKX10-KKX10-UI-MUI)",replaces the KKX20 with the SSGBE.

ADDITIONAL STUFF

This mod also includes a "special" version of the "data" folder.

TO INSTALL THE DATA FOLDER, SIMPLY DROP IT INTO YOUR XENOVERSE 2 DIRECTORY, WHERE THE OTHER ONE IS. •WARNING• THIS WILL REMOVER EVERY SPECIAL SUPER SOUL THAT YOU HAVE INSTALLED THAT ISN'T PART OF THE LAZYBONE MOD

"WHAT DOES IT DO?"

What it does is kinda long to explain in words, but i tried in another document.  

If you want to know what the effects are, since there is a lot of them, you can discover them yourself, you can watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3gNQ6_xlds&feature=youtu.be
